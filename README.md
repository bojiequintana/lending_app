## Development

pnpm run build
```

Then run the app

Production mode

```sh
pnpm start
```

Development mode

```sh
pnpm dev
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `pnpm run build`
